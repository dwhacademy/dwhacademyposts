Increasing entropy defines the direction of time in our Universe. It grows from simple to complex, from ordered to unordered.  Even though the entropy can decrease locally, the global increase of Universe's entropy is irreversible.  That's why entropy is called an arrow of time.

Entropy is usually described as a measure of disorder in a closed system.  The concept itself is in our world so obvious that we don't even think about it. It is natural that without additional energy the disorder is increasing.  It is the same in our house, garden and also in any business entity, simply everywhere. To keep things in order requires significant effort.

The amount of effort grows with the complexity of the system to be ordered. Again, it is obvious that keeping fewer things in order requires less effort than keeping more things in order. OK, so far so good. No rocket science. 

Now lets put also information into the context of entropy.
