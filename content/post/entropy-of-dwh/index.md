### Arrow of time
Increasing entropy defines the direction of time in our Universe. The Universe grows from simple to complex, from ordered to unordered.  Even though the entropy can decrease locally, the global increase of Universe's entropy is irreversible.  That's why entropy is called an arrow of time. It is the same for living and non-living things. Process of aging is driven by increasing entropy.

Entropy is usually described as a measure of disorder in a closed system.  The concept itself is in our world so obvious that we don't even think about it. It is natural that without additional energy the disorder is increasing.  It is the same in our house, garden and also in any business entity, simply everywhere. To keep things in order requires significant effort.

The amount of effort grows with the complexity of the system to be ordered. Again, it is obvious that keeping fewer things in order requires less effort than keeping more things in order. OK, so far so good. No rocket science. 

### Information
Now lets put also information into the context of entropy. Complex and unordered things (high entropy systems) is difficult to understand, there is a high level of uncertainty about them. To lower the uncertainty, a lot of information is required to describe the complex system. The high entropy systems require a high amount of information.  So the information is another kind of effort or energy if you wish.

Now we are finally getting close to the subject of this article. The main goal of Business Intelligence and Data warehousing is to get a good understanding of real business.  In other words, to get information which decreases the entropy in our business, lowering the costs, increasing the profit and making our business sustainable in the long term. Pretty impressive, isn't it.

That's the goal of BI and DWH but to be able to achieve it, we need to build DWH which itself is sustainable.
