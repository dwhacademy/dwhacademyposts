<p>Over the last few years working in Agile became a very hot topic. Lots of big consulting companies (including big 4) realized that teaching and implementing the agile methodology in different companies can be a very lucrative source of income for them. They&rsquo;ve been selling their ideas across different industries, departments, and projects but have ever seen a good implementation of such Agile methodology in any Data Warehouse? Probably not (otherwise you would probably not bother to read this article) because Agile methodology for DWH requires a dedicated approach.</p>

<p>We plan to post a set of articles to describe our experience and practical approach to successfully implement this kind of methodology in your organization but let&rsquo;s start with the general overview.</p>

<p><img src="agile.png" width="800px" alt="agile"/></p>

<h3 id="general-principles-behind-agile">General principles behind Agile</h3>

<p>I should probably start with the definition of the Agile methodology but there are hundreds of such articles already written, so if the term &lsquo;Agile&rsquo; is new to you, I suggest to read the article here: <a href="https://zenkit.com/en/blog/agile-methodology-an-overview/">https://zenkit.com/en/blog/agile-methodology-an-overview/</a>. Instead, I would prefer to focus on principles that are crucial for Data warehousing, which are: iterative development and transparency.</p>

<p>Iterative development is the main differentiation from a traditional project methodology called &lsquo;Waterfall&rsquo; - where the whole functionality of given software is implemented at once, which is preceded by long phases of design, development, and testing which last sometimes even months. In Agile the whole delivery of given software needs to be broken down into smaller, manageable parts - each of one should be delivered in a relatively short period of time (weeks rather than months). Instead of building a big house in 2 years, build each room step by step and let your user start moving into each of them immediately. From the user point of view, releasing the product in smaller parts gives him the opportunity to revise his requirements that he set at the beginning, therefore, being flexible can be seen as one of the biggest advantages of this methodology and each team working in Agile should welcome all changes coming from users because of it helps to improve the final product when it is not too late.</p>

<p>Transparency is the second core value of Agile.  Transparency is critical to the success of organizations and groups adopting Agile.  Scrum teams use burndown and/or burnup charts to report the progress of the team throughout the Sprints. There also “ceremonies” or meetings that help with transparency, which include the Daily Standup, Sprint Planning, Sprint Review, and Retrospective meetings.  These all give the team and product owner a chance to raise issues and be honest about things like the team’s progress.  The meetings also give the team a chance to adapt and improve.</p>

<h3 id="scrum-as-the-main-agile-framework">Scrum as the main Agile framework</h3>

<p>Since I have already mentioned about Scrum in my previous paragraph, I feel responsible to give you a few words about that framework - probably the most popular. Scrum is an Agile framework that is used to implement the ideas behind Agile software development. Its goal is to develop, deliver, and sustain complex products through collaboration, accountability, and iterative progress.</p>

<p>We can identify 3 different roles in each Scrum team:
Product owner: the voice of the customer.
Development team: a group of professionals who deliver the product
Scrum master: he helps the team to work together.</p>

<p>The development team can consist of different professionals depends on a project type, the teams working in DWH should ideally have: business analysts, designers, developers, and testers.</p>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

<p>This article meant to just introduce you to Agile as a methodology. We could write a book on this topic but we prefer to focus on different aspects of working in Agile in DWH environment which is, we think, is very special and requires a dedicated approach. In the next articles, we will try to elaborate more about useful software that helps to work in Agile, how the team should work together and what are the common traps you should avoid when implementing Scrum framework in your organization.</p>
