      <description>This article is the second part of the series of how to cope with hierarchies in 3NF models (Hierarchies in 3NF model). If you have not read the previous one yet, I strongly encourage you to read it because from time to time in this article I will be referring to the previous article in the series.
Today I will show you how to connect underlying products with their hierarchy.</description>

      <description>In today&amp;rsquo;s article, I want to show you how to store n- number of hierarchies with n- number of levels using just 4 tables. The 4 tables will represent 3rd normal form (3NF) of our new integrated model. The scripts below you can apply in your own model and see how powerful this technique is, I&amp;rsquo;ve been using it for some time and the actual implementation does not vary that much whatever hierarchy you have, trust me!</description>
