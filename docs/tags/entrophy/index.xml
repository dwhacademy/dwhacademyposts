      <description>Increasing entropy defines the direction of time in our Universe. It grows from simple to complex, from ordered to unordered. Even though the entropy can decrease locally, the global increase of Universe&amp;rsquo;s entropy is irreversible. That&amp;rsquo;s why entropy is called an arrow of time.
Entropy is usually described as a measure of disorder in a closed system. The concept itself is in our world so obvious that we don&amp;rsquo;t even think about it.</description>
