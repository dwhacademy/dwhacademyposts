      <description>In today&amp;rsquo;s article, I want to show you how to store n- number of hierarchies with n- number of levels using just 4 tables. The 4 tables will represent 3rd normal form (3NF) of our new integrated model. The scripts below you can apply in your own model and see how powerful this technique is, I&amp;rsquo;ve been using it for some time and the actual implementation does not vary that much whatever hierarchy you have, trust me!</description>

      <description>The main goal of adopting a naming convention for database objects is so that you and others can easily identify the type and purpose of all objects contained in the database. In this article, I want to describe one of the possible ways of adopting naming standards, undoubtedly there are other standards that also work but my goal is to show you the ones I applied and they proved to be working very well.</description>
