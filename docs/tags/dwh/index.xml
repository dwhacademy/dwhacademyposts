      <description>We were talking about why to care about the Entropy of the DWH in the prior post Entropy of the DWH systems. Let&amp;rsquo;s talk now about the ways how to keep the DWH entropy increase sustainable. We can never change the fact that the complexity of our DWH is going to grow over time. But we are fully responsible for the initial complexity of our solution and for creating the environment which can avoid rapid entropy increase in a short time.</description>

      <description>The main goal of adopting a naming convention for database objects is so that you and others can easily identify the type and purpose of all objects contained in the database. In this article, I want to describe one of the possible ways of adopting naming standards, undoubtedly there are other standards that also work but my goal is to show you the ones I applied and they proved to be working very well.</description>

      <description>Working in Agile became a hot topic. Big consulting companies (including big 4) realized that implementing agile methodology is a very lucrative business. But have you ever seen a good implementation of Agile methodology in Data Warehousing? Probably not, otherwise you would not bother to read this article. Agile methodology in DWH requires a very special approach.
We plan to post a set of articles to describe our experience and practical tips on how to approach Agile in DWH, but letâ€™s start with basic hints.</description>

      <description>The real success of a data warehouse is defined by the number of users who use it on a daily basis, so do not forget to always put their needs in the first place.
None of the data warehouse projects would ever exist if there were no business needs, it is hard to imagine an organization that would spend millions of dollars just to make their IT department happy and let them work on the latest and the best available software on the market.</description>

      <description>There is an unlimited number of ways how to build a data warehouse. Few of them work and some of the few can even survive in the long term. In this post, we are going to describe the high-level design of one pattern which was proven to work.
Landing Area Imagine the Landing Area as an address, where the files from the source systems arrive. It is the first interface of the DWH, usually some file system organized into directories for each source file.</description>

      <description>This is the first post on DWH Academy, starting the series of practical tips on how to build a successful data warehouse. This introduction puts Data warehouse into a wide context of physical science but in a simple friendly way
When DWH accumulates unorganized data it tends to experience some kind of Turbo Effect in the entropy increase. The main motivation to start the project DWH Academy was to share the patterns and tools which work to build a successful Data warehouse in the long term.</description>
