      <description>In my prior post How to keep the DWH entropy increase sustainable, I was talking about the essential rules for creating a controlled development environment. After such a theoretical introduction, it is time for the practical lesson.
The main goal of this post is to show how to organize a code repository and how to keep the repository in sync with the database environment. Well organized, completely transparent and controlled development environment is the precondition for any successful project.</description>

      <description>We were talking about why to care about the Entropy of the DWH in the prior post Entropy of the DWH systems. Let&amp;rsquo;s talk now about the ways how to keep the DWH entropy increase sustainable. We can never change the fact that the complexity of our DWH is going to grow over time. But we are fully responsible for the initial complexity of our solution and for creating the environment which can avoid rapid entropy increase in a short time.</description>

      <description>There is an unlimited number of ways how to build a data warehouse. Few of them work and some of the few can even survive in the long term. In this post, we are going to describe the high-level design of one pattern which was proven to work.
Landing Area Imagine the Landing Area as an address, where the files from the source systems arrive. It is the first interface of the DWH, usually some file system organized into directories for each source file.</description>

      <description>This is the first post on DWH Academy, starting the series of practical tips on how to build a successful data warehouse. This introduction puts Data warehouse into a wide context of physical science but in a simple friendly way
When DWH accumulates unorganized data it tends to experience some kind of Turbo Effect in the entropy increase. The main motivation to start the project DWH Academy was to share the patterns and tools which work to build a successful Data warehouse in the long term.</description>
