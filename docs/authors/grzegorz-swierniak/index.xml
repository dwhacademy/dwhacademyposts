      <description>This article is the second part of the series of how to cope with hierarchies in 3NF models (Hierarchies in 3NF model). If you have not read the previous one yet, I strongly encourage you to read it because from time to time in this article I will be referring to the previous article in the series.
Today I will show you how to connect underlying products with their hierarchy.</description>

      <description>In today&amp;rsquo;s article, I want to show you how to store n- number of hierarchies with n- number of levels using just 4 tables. The 4 tables will represent 3rd normal form (3NF) of our new integrated model. The scripts below you can apply in your own model and see how powerful this technique is, I&amp;rsquo;ve been using it for some time and the actual implementation does not vary that much whatever hierarchy you have, trust me!</description>

      <description>The main goal of adopting a naming convention for database objects is so that you and others can easily identify the type and purpose of all objects contained in the database. In this article, I want to describe one of the possible ways of adopting naming standards, undoubtedly there are other standards that also work but my goal is to show you the ones I applied and they proved to be working very well.</description>

      <description>Working in Agile became a hot topic. Big consulting companies (including big 4) realized that implementing agile methodology is a very lucrative business. But have you ever seen a good implementation of Agile methodology in Data Warehousing? Probably not, otherwise you would not bother to read this article. Agile methodology in DWH requires a very special approach.
We plan to post a set of articles to describe our experience and practical tips on how to approach Agile in DWH, but letâ€™s start with basic hints.</description>

      <description>The real success of a data warehouse is defined by the number of users who use it on a daily basis, so do not forget to always put their needs in the first place.
None of the data warehouse projects would ever exist if there were no business needs, it is hard to imagine an organization that would spend millions of dollars just to make their IT department happy and let them work on the latest and the best available software on the market.</description>
