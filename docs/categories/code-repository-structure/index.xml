      <description>In my prior post How to keep the DWH entropy increase sustainable, I was talking about the essential rules for creating a controlled development environment. After such a theoretical introduction, it is time for the practical lesson.
The main goal of this post is to show how to organize a code repository and how to keep the repository in sync with the database environment. Well organized, completely transparent and controlled development environment is the precondition for any successful project.</description>
